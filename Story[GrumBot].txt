Short:
They experimented with the skulk, it seemed to feed on the host and make it stronger, heal faster, even smarter
We installed Cyberware on the test subjects together with skulk, to see if this is an effective way to enhance our soldiers
At first the soldiers seemed fine. Obeying our orders and giving us amazing rezults
One soldier was wandering in the halls at night
It seemed like he wasn't fully aware of what he was doing
We escorted him back to his room
We started noticing different behaviours among the soldiers, eating habbits changed, sleeping disorders, faster heart rates
These are a few of the many strange behaviours we found. The most unusual was the iris, it stopped replying to light
Yet the soldiers were following eevry order we gave them.
We stopped with the usual testing and brought some soldiers to one on one conversations
Asked them about their family, hobbies, favorite food
They just sat there, empty..
We agreed to stop the testing, tomorrow we will start to remove the cyberware and Sculk from our soldiers
The Facility is now on lockdown, the sculk seems to have an effect on the mind of the soldiers. Even the dead, they are.. not dead anymore, if you read this, watch your 6
